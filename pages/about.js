    <h4>Happy!</h4>
    <p>Brown is such a nice color. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Poor old tree.

Just let these leaves jump off the brush How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. This is the fun part

Every day I learn. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Very easy to work these to death.

Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Let's build an almighty mountain. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.

The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.

Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. The least little bit can do so much. Let your imagination be your guide. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.

You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. You need the dark in order to show the light. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Get tough with it, get strong.
